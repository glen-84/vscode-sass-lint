### Changed

* This extension is no longer maintained, as the sass-lint library project has been abandoned.

    ⚠ Please uninstall the extension as soon as possible, as it may be susceptible to security exploits (see [CVE-2021-28956](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-28956)).

    You may wish to consider [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) as an alternative.
